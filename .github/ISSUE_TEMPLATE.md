Hi there! Thank you for discovering and submitting an issue.

Before your submit it though, please consider that each Azure IoT SDK now lives in its own repository. You can follow this link to create a new issue for a specific SDK:
- C:      https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/issues/new
- .NET:   https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/issues/new
- Node:   https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/issues/new
- Java:   https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/issues/new
- Python: https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/issues/new

It's going to be a lot easier for us to track and link your issue to its resolution (commit hash, etc) in the concerned SDK repository directly.
